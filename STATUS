* working on processing of multiple (fake) stamps inside a circuit
 ** possible way out - getting data for proofs from ceramic, see sh scripts
* can't figure out how to validate proofs from passport.json, no real stamps yet

possible way of structuring stamps processing:
* recursive, one stamp at a time
 * identity of certifier is hardcoded as a pubkey
 * public input:
  *
